# Portfolio-Challenge

Working on CSS to construct a portfolio showcasing my skills and abilities.

Project Description:
In this project, I focused on developing a webpage intended to serve as an effective portfolio for showcasing my work in the future. It allowed me to integrate recent learnings, including the utilisation of flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. Through the combination of HTML and CSS, I successfully crafted a responsive portfolio website.

The webpage serves as a foundational showcase, demonstrating one project and offering a glimpse of upcoming projects and the space they would occupy. Specifically, this project emphasised the use of CSS selectors and responsiveness for the webpage.

I implemented links within the navigation bar, facilitating smooth scrolling to corresponding sections. This was achieved through the strategic use of media queries. Additionally, I organised the CSS code by grouping sections and incorporating comments to enhance clarity.

The final product effectively embodies key portfolio elements, prominently featuring the most recent project as the focal point, with placeholders used for upcoming projects due to their in-progress status.

## Usage
